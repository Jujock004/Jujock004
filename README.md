# Hi 👋, I'm Julien

## 👩‍💻 Full Stack Web Developer in Training

After 5 years in marketing, I decided to shift toward web development to bring ideas to life through creative digital solutions. I recently completed an intensive full stack bootcamp at Wild Code School. I'm currently interning at OpenStudio, working on the migration of a mobile app from Ionic + Angular to Ionic + React.

## 🎯 Current Focus
- 🚀 Web Development Internship at OpenStudio
- 🔎 Seeking a 1-2 years apprenticeship starting in September
- 💼 Applying and expanding my skills in a professional environment
- 🤝 Open to collaborate on meaningful projects
